This directory contains code for the Green Bank Telescope K-band Focal Plane Array (KFPA) data analysis and reduction pipeline.

The code is authored by Joe Masters, Bob Garwood and Glen Langston at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).

At the moment, this directory includes one example use case:  mapping the spiral galaxy M81 in a position-switched observing mode.

All code is written in IDL.  The highest level script is m81Map.pro and scan numbers are hard-coded.  Due to the interaction with weather prediction scripts only available in Green Bank, the code can only be effectively run on a Green Bank network computer.  In addition, an IDL license is required.
