This directory contains position-switched code for the Green Bank Telescope
K-band Focal Plane Array (KFPA) data analysis and reduction pipeline.

The code is authored by Bob Garwood, Joe Masters and Glen Langston at the
National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).

Code is written in IDL and Python, except for getForecastValues (tcl) and
idlToSdfits (C).  The highest level script is kfpa_pipeline.

Due to the  interaction with weather prediction scripts
only available in Green Bank, the code can only be effectively run on a
Green Bank network computer.  In addition, an IDL license is required.
