{"name":"Gbt-pipeline","body":"### Welcome to the GBT Pipeline Page.\r\n\r\nIn the coming year, GBT data will be made available to the user community through the\r\nNRAO data archive. In support of this release, and to offer quick access to GBT data, NRAO\r\nhas instituted the GBT Pipeline Project to provide reduced spectra from public GBT datasets\r\nto the user community.\r\n\r\nThe GBT Pipeline Project has two goals.\r\n\r\nThe first is to produce an automated data processing pipeline that can generate quick-look spectra for about 80% of all spectral line data observed with the GBT, including data observed with the spectrometer and VEGAS in standard observing modes. For certain types of science data, this project will produce archive-ready data products, including a “summary sheet” for each reduced spectrum with accompanying header and statistical information.\r\n\r\nA second goal of the Pipeline Project is to prepare tools that assist with certain potentially labor-intensive data processing tasks, such as calibrating and mapping KFPA observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ gbtpipeline --help\r\n```\r\n\r\n### About NRAO\r\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National Science Foundation, operated under cooperative agreement by Associated Universities, Inc.","tagline":"The Green Bank Telescope data analysis pipeline","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
