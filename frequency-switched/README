This directory will contain frequency-switched code for the Green Bank Telescope K-band Focal Plane Array (KFPA) data analysis and reduction pipeline.

The code is authored by Bob Garwood, Joe Masters and Glen Langston at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO).

All code is written in IDL.  Due to the interaction with weather prediction scripts only available in Green Bank, the code can only be effectively run on a Green Bank network computer.  In addition, an IDL license is required.
