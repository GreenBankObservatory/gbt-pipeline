    Bug fix to not fail on imaging if AIPS setup was already run.
    
    The imaging step would fail when the AIPS login script
    (e.g. . /home/AIPS/LOGIN.SH) was already run in the user's
    environment.  It turns out that AIPS would not set the VERSION
    environment variable if it was already set, which was being
    done by the pipeline.  I simply changed the variable the pipeline
    script used to GBTPIPEVERSION.
    
    I also added code to Imaging.py to allow local imaging steps to be
    run, mainly for development.

    The list of feeds going into AIPS had been unsorted, by default.
    For the KFPA, this allowed a feed other than 0 to be first in the
    list, giving wrong map center information to AIPS and creating a
    final map that was off center.

    Added 'compile_opt idl2' to all IDL procedures/functions.
    
    According to Bob, "This is a compile-time directive and idl2 means that
    the default integer type is a 32-bit integer instead of a 16-bit integer
    and it limits the array index syntax to just [] (the default also allows
    () - which leads to confusion when reading the code because it's
    difficult tell when one is a function and one is an array)."
    
    Also, the unique.pro code was replaced with a much simpler use of the
    IDL UNIQ function.  This was tried on a previous iteration of the code
    but didn't included the necessary sort step to ensure unique values in
    the returned structure.

commit 3cb0a48e56c346b35bda610220eab3d581bfdef4
Author: Joe Masters <jmasters@nrao.edu>

    Fixed two bugs: bad velocity axis in FITS output, fail on bad procedure.
    
    The velocity axis bug was the result of rebinned data no being
    consistent with the necessary header keys.  The fix was to disable
    rebinning in favor of higher resolution output.
    
    The bad procedure bug was that the code assumed either OnOff or OffOn
    procedures in the input for every target, even if not for every scan.
    The fix is to no longer make this assumption.

    Copy primary header from input to output.
    
    This fixes a bug that left output unable to be interpreted
    properly by GBTIDL.
