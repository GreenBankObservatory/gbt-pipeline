    Added fix_idlToSdfits_header_bug to repository.
    
    We discovered and fixed a bug in idlToSdfits (and the gbtpipeline)
    that affects the frequency and velocity scales of output FITS files
    when channel averaging was used.  The bug was triggered by the "-a"
    argument in the idlToSdfits program, and also invoked by the "-a"
    argument in the gbtpipeline program.
    
    Affected FITS cubes have a systematic offset of channel frequencies by
    0.25 to 0.5 channels, after averaging. Specifically, the correct
    frequency for each channel in the affected data should be:
    
    f_correct = f - CDELT3 * (0.5 - 0.5 / W)
    
    where "f" is the frequency associated with a channel, "W" is the
    number of channels that were averaged (the argument value when using
    "-a") and CDELT3 is the channel spacing after averaging, as recorded
    in the FITS header of the output image cube.
    
    This bug was fixed on Friday, 8 May 2015 and the fix is included in
    idlToSdfits version 8.6 and beyond.  The idlToSdfits program now
    inserts a HISTORY card in the output FITS files to show the version
    number used.
    
    If you know that you used channel averaging, and you know the number
    of channels averaged, it is not necessary to regenerate output FITS
    cubes to correct for this error.  Instead, you can correct affected
    FITS cubes by replacing the values of CRVAL3 and ALTRPIX in the FITS
    header with the correct values, which are:
    
     CRVAL3_correct = CRVAL3 - CDELT3 * (0.5 - 0.5 / W) ALTRPIX_correct =
     ALTRPIX + (0.5 - 0.5/W)
    
    We are providing a tool to help you fix affected FITS cubes.  Keep in
    mind that you need to know what channel width was used in the original
    averaging with idlToSdfits when creating your image cube.  Our tool
    will check if the cube was processed with idlToSdfits, but it can not
    know the averaging parameters as they are not stored in the header.
    If you do not remember the averaging parameters you used when creating
    the cube, your safest path is to recreate the image from the SDFITS
    spectra.
    
    To use the tool you need to supply the image cube name and the channel
    width used for averaging by idlToSdfits when creating the cube.  For
    example:
    
    /home/gbtpipeline/bin/fix_idlToSdfits_header_bug
    affected_image_cube.fits 16
    
    Type '/home/gbtpipeline/bin/fix_idlToSdfits_header_bug -hâ€™ at the
    command line to get full usage information.
    
    Pipeline users who have used the "-a" option in the "image.py" script
    are unaffected by this bug since image.py uses different code for the
    channel averaging.

    Updated AIPS disk setup to default to lustre.
    
    We have recurring issues with the local arcturus disks
    filling up.  This changes the setup to write to lustre
    first.  A potential problem is the efficiency of writing
    many files to lustre.  We will need to monitor the run time
    for a while to see if this is the right solution.
