    Removed explicit backend id from infile check. Added doctests.
    
    Previously the input fits file had to end in acs.fits or vegas.fits,
    but now it just eneds to end in fits.
    
    A couple comments were updated.  An error message was updated.
    An imported and unused module (multiprocessing) was removed from
    gbt_pipeline.py.  Doctests were added to a couple functions in
    pipeutils.

commit 2779d5d1e7c7e274b5ed4e1d90e49f8e080aa581
Author: Joe Masters <jmasters@nrao.edu>
Date:   Wed Feb 8 15:50:59 2012 -0500

    Updated to allow sdfits to run on non-acs data, added doctest for tatm.
    
    If necessary, the pipeline can be used to invoke the sdfits filler when
    SDFITS input is not available.  Previously, when the filler wass run, it explicitly
    set backend=acs. This was updated to allow vegas (and any other) SDFITS files to be
    filled as well.
    
    We could make it more sophisticated later, but what I just coded up was to not
    use -backends, then after sdfits is done look to see if there is more than one
    output SDFITS file.  If so, there is an error and the user is asked to check
    the input directory and provide only one input to the pipeline.

    Updated the frequency in output files to MHz.
    
    The calibrated spectra are now formatted as follows:
    <object>_<feed>_<start map scan>_<end map scan>_<centerfreq>_MHz_<sampler>.fits
    
    The output images now include 'MHz' after the frequency.

    Updated to use system Obit installation, ParselTongue2, old AIPS.
    
    ParselTongue2 can be used with the system-side Obit install,
    although it uses Python2.4.  I removed the pyfits lines from the
    imaging scripts because they were not needed in the contrib
    python scripts.  The AIPS sqash task revealed a but after the new
    year change to a new version.  I changed the doImage script to use
    the OLD AIPS version for stability and to aviod this problem.

    Removed idlToSdfits and dependency directory from repository.
    
    It would be better to keep this repository lightwight with pipeline
    code only.  I previously only wanted to capture the idlToSdits code
    *somewhere*, but it is better stored elsewhere.

    Updated README to better reflect the current status.
    
    The biggest change since the old version is that the pipeline
    is no longer specific to the KFPA project and both the FS and PS
    observing modes are supported.

    Bugfix #2 to get the imaging step working again for 32-bit python.
    
    This time I'm using a seperate pipeline 32-bit python build until
    we can get a proper 64-bit install for obit and parseltongue.  This
    will require some more work, but is the next logical step to have
    a standalone environment.

    Bugfix to point to 32-bit version of python for imaging step.
    
    When the GB /opt/local/bin/python was upgraded to 64-bit, this step
    broke because it was expecting a 32-bit build compatible with this Obit
    32-bit libraries.  I change the step to point to the older, 32-bit version
    of python, but a more elegant solution is in order.

    Added several new options, noise diode check and low freq opacity.
    
    The user can now set the 0 frequency channel main beam efficiency
    so that etaMB is computed seperately from aperture efficiency, etaA.
    
    The user can also for a FS map to be calibrated as PS.
    
    The default zenith opacity for frequencies < 2 GHz is now to
    to .008.
    
    There is a new check to make sure the noise diode is firing for
    the refscans.
