GBT Mapping Pipeline Version 1.2

These notes accompany the release of the GBT Mapping Pipeline on January __, 2015. The previous version of the pipeline was 1.1. A summary of new features and bug fixes since the last release are described below.

) A number of name changes have occurred with the aim of improving the user experience.  The script names and file extensions are meant to be more descriptive and intuitive.  The changes are:

   doImage       -> aipspy
   dbcon.py      -> load.py
   mapDefault.py -> image.py

In addition, the file extensions of calibrated spectra restructured for AIPS input have been changed from “.sdf” to “.aips.fits”.

With this release the doImage, dbcon.py and mapDefault.py commands still work, but will generate a warning message about the new names.  With the next release, the old names will be deprecated.
 
) Improved handing of a bad integration where the raw spectrum contains all zeros.  Previously the pipeline generated a cryptic error message.  Now the pipeline generates a descriptive warning and writes NaNs to the output spectrum for that integration.

) Fixed the exposure time calculation for out of band frequency-switched integrations.  The previous code always summed the exposure times from the two FS switching states. With this update, if the frequency bands do not overlap at all, we only count the exposure time from the first state.

) Updated an image header keyword to allow image cubes to be ready by the CASA viewer.  The pipeline tweaks the AIPS image cubes by adding a reference frame string to the end of the CTYPE3 value (which AIPS just writes as "FREQ) so that it matches the VELREF keyword also written by AIPS.  Previously the code was writing "FREQ-BAR" when it should have been writing "FREQ-HEL".  BAR and HEL are equivalent (and when the fixed "FREQ-HEL" is read 
in to CASA it ends up being labeled as "BARY").

) Removed spaces from output file names.  This occurred when the target name included whitespace.  AIPS does not handle spaces in output file names well. This release should fix that problem.

) Updated the idlToSdfits channel limit from 16k to 32k to accommodate larger VEGAS spectra.

) Now logging errors when the zenith opacity is not available in the weather database.  Previously errors were not logged when the zenith opacity could not be found because the observation date was too early.

) Improved map finding code by adding Track procedure scans
to be counted as reference scans

) Fixed window, feed and polarization filtering parameters for VEGAS data.

) Added summary message showing number of windows and feeds.  We now list window numbers with frequencies and feed numbers contained in the data.

) Added scan range to image product filenames

) Added new utilities:

show_catalog.py -- prints out the current AIPS catalog.
zap_last.py -- removes the last AIPS catalog entry.

) Now checking all feed, window and polarization combinations to show preview zenith opacity.

This should avoid a crash when the first feed/win/pol attempt is not available.

) Bug fixed for shift in frequency-switched calibration.

Sometimes the pipeline would use the center frequency for the reference data instead of the signal, depending
on the order it was written to the raw data file.  This update fixes that by only grabbing the center frequency from the input FS signal spectrum for each integration.
