Pipeline calibration code is written in Python.  Imaging dependencies include idlToSdfits, Obit, parseltongue and AIPS.

SDFITS files are the required input.

Due to the interaction with weather prediction scripts only available in Green Bank, the code can only be effectively run on a Green Bank network computer.
