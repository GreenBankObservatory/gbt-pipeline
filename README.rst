Pipeline calibration code is written in Python.  Imaging dependencies include idlToSdfits, Obit, parseltongue and AIPS.

SDFITS files are the required input.

To calibrate beyond antenna temperature, the code must run on a Green Bank network computer.
This is because weather prediction scripts are only available in Green Bank.
